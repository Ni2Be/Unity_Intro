# Unity_Intro
A procedural planet / star generator. TH Köln, course PGVW (procedural generation of virtual worlds)

After a one-week introduction to Unity and procedural generation we had 3 days to implement our own procedural generator.

[Windows release](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/releases/tag/v1.0)

[Unitypackage](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtwaZYMhkRKBgrVukFEmZnbW5iU0Sg)

It takes a moment to generate something, and the screen will freeze the time it takes (unity functions can't be used parallel and I did not know when I stated work). Anyway, the assert is more that kind that you use in the editor, so I left it so.

[Some informations on how it works](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/blob/technique/README.md)
