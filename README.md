# Unity_Intro
#### A procedural planet / star generator. TH Köln, course PGVW (procedural generation of virtual worlds)
![Planet](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/blob/technique/technique/planet.gif)

After a one-week introduction to Unity and procedural generation we had 3 days to implement our own procedural generator.

[Windows release](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/releases/tag/v1.0)

The screen freezes while generating a planet (unity functions are not thread safe ..one of those things you better know before you start work). Anyway, the assert is more that kind you use in the editor, so that's not that big of a problem.
