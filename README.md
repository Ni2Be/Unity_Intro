# Unity_Intro
#### A procedural planet / star generator. TH KÃ¶ln, course PGVW (procedural generation of virtual worlds)
![Planet](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/blob/technique/technique/planet.gif)

After a one-week introduction to Unity and procedural generation we had 3 days to implement our own procedural generator.

[Windows release](https://github.com/Nice2Bee/Unity_Intro/releases/tag/v1.0)

The screen freezes while generating a planet (unity functions are not thread safe). Anyway, the assert is more that kind you use in the editor, so that's not that big of a problem.
